<h1> Image Analysis using Cognitive Services </h1>

<h2> Project Statement/Opportunity </h3>

<p> Image analysis is the extraction of meaningfull information from the image. Analysis of images can give meaningful information including face detection, object detection, color scheme, gender detection, detect brand and various category. Using cognitive services provided by Azure Image Analysing web services will be made. This image analysis service will help us knowing the face, object and various elements in image. It can give us answers for who, when and where was the image taken. </p>

<h2> Azure Technologies Used </h3>

<b> 1. Computer Vision </b> <br>
<b> 2. Azure App Services </b> 

<h2> Prerequisites </h3>

<b> 1. Azure Subscription </b><br>
<b> 2. Visual Studio using ASP.NET core 5.0

<h2> Project Description </h2>
 
<p> Project's vision is to build an web based service which on uploading a image gives the detailed description about the content of Image. Analysis of image includes multiple factors including face detection, color scheme, detect brand, object, category. Use of Cognitive services such as Computer Vision provided by AZURE helps in analysing the image more efficiently. ASP.NET Framework was used with multiple languages including C#, java, html, css in creating this web service. We will be using Azure portal to manage resources created and will be using accordingly, azure provides both paid and free services. We will be using COMPUTER VISION to analyse the images and AZURE WEB APP to deploy the project and keep running. </p>
